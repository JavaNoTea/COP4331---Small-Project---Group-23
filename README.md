Welcome to Demo Gods, an arcade themed contact viewer. This project was developed by a team of five developers for a Processes of Object Oriented Programming class assignment. The name serves as a tribute to a story shared by our professor.


# Features

* Arcade-themed user interface
* Contact viewing functionality
* LAMP stack technology

# What Went Well

* Our team worked effectively together, with clear communication and a strong sense of collaboration.
* The arcade theme added a fun and unique touch to the project, which set it apart from other similar contact viewers.
* The LAMP stack provided a solid foundation for the project and allowed us to efficiently manage data and presentation layers.

# Struggles and Challenges

* Integrating all the components of the LAMP stack proved to be challenging at times, especially for those who were less familiar with the technology.
* Balancing the aesthetic appeal of the arcade theme with the functionality of the contact viewer was also a challenge.
* Ensuring that the project met all the requirements set forth by the professor was a bit of a struggle, as some requirements were not always clear or well-defined.

# What We Could Do Better Next Time

* Spend more time researching and familiarizing ourselves with the LAMP stack before starting the project.
* Ensure that requirements are clearly defined and agreed upon by the entire team before starting development.
* Consider working with a designer to ensure that the arcade theme and functionality are properly balanced.

# What We Have Learned

* The importance of clear communication and collaboration within a team.
* The versatility and power of the LAMP stack in web development.
* The importance of balancing aesthetics with functionality in user interface design.
